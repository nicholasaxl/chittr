Ok, but what does AI do???

Science fiction AI?

What is AI?
The science of making machines that:
Think like people?

Think rationally?

Act like people?

Act rationally

Rational Decisions
§ We’ll use the term rational in a very specific, technical way:
§ Rational: maximally achieving pre-defined goals
§ Goals are expressed in terms of the utility of outcomes
§ World is uncertain, so we’ll use expected utility
§ Being rational means acting to maximize your expected utility

A better title for this course would be:

Computational Rationality

What About the Brain?
§ Brains (human minds) are very good at making
rational decisions, but not perfect
§ Brains aren’t as modular as software, so hard to
reverse engineer!
§ AI may be better than brains at some tasks
§ “Brains are to intelligence as wings are to flight”
§ We can’t yet build AI on the scale of the brain
§ ~100T synapses in the human brain vs 500B weights
in artificial neural networks

§ Still, the brain can be a great inspiration for AI!

This Course: Designing Rational Agents

Percepts

Agent

§ General AI techniques for a variety of problem
types
§ Learning to recognize when and how a new
problem can be solved with an existing technique

Sensors

Actuators

Actions

Environment

§ An agent is an entity that perceives and acts.
§ A rational agent selects actions that maximize
its (expected) utility.
§ Characteristics of the percepts, environment,
and action space dictate techniques for
selecting rational actions

Should I take CS 188?
§ Yes, if you want to know how to design rational agents!
§ CS 188 gives you extra mathematical maturity
§ CS 188 gives you a survey of other non-CS fields that interact with AI
(e.g. robotics, cognitive science, economics)

§ Disclaimer: If you’re interested in making yourself more
competitive for AI jobs, CS 189 and CS 182 are better fits.
§ The last few CS 188 lectures (neural networks) are used by many
modern state-of-the-art systems. CS 189 and CS 182 cover these in
more depth

By the end of this course you’ll:
§ Build and understand math of rational, learning agents
§ Select and apply the right AI methods for wide range of problems
§ Recognize how these methods are used in modern AI systems
§ Be prepared to make decisions on how AI is used in society
